# HotelApp ‚Äì Angular Hotel Reservation Project

This is a hotel reservation frontend project built using **Angular**. The goal of this project was to explore front-end development concepts and improve flexibility as a backend-focused software engineer.

While I primarily work in backend technologies, I developed this Angular application to get hands-on experience with modern frontend frameworks and component-based architecture.
